# This file was designed to contain basic information about a build/release such
# as its version, code label, etc. for the purpose of traceability.

# 
# Versioning Convention: 
#      <major_number>.<minor_number>.<maintenance_number>.<build_number> or X.Y.Z.BN
# whereas
#      <major_number> or X is the major release number.
#      <minor_number> or Y is the minor release number.
#      <maintenance_number> or Z is the maintenance or patch release number.
#      <build_number> or BN is the build number. 
#
# build_candidate: is the type of build. Its values are below. 
#   1) official: An official build purposed for release/deployment and built by
#                  the Build/Release Engineering team.
#   2) engineering: An engineering build purposed for internal development only and
#                  built by a developer or someone not in the Build/Release Engineering team.
#   3) development: A build purposed for internal development or testing only (NOT for
#                  deployment) but built by the Build/Release Engineering team.
# Its default value is "engineering". For other types, change to the appropriate value.
#
# release_candidate: is the type of release. Its values are below. 
#   1) alpha|beta|eval: A release targeted for alpha, beta, or customer evaluation purpose only and not
#					for production deployment.
#   2) engineering: A release targeted for internal engineering purpose only.
#   3) <blank>: A release targeted for production deployment purpose (release_candidate=).
# Its default value is "engineering".
#
# release_id: is the n(th) release within the X.Y.Z release milestone.

# code_label: is the code label in the source code control system (Perforce currently) where a build
#             produced. It is used to tag the output .jar and/or .war files for traceability.
# Notes: 
#    1) For an engineering build, label is not usually created therefore set the code_label variable
#          to null (ex: code_label=null). This is the default value.
#    2) For an official or a development build where a label is created, set the code_label variable
#          to the label name (ex: code_label=Joz_dev_20070926).
#    As a result, a file described by the $label_file variable will be packaged into the product
#          .jar and/or .war files.
