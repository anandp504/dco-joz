# This file was designed to the basic information about a build/release such
# as its version, code label, etc. for the purpose of traceability.

# 
# build_candidate: is the type of build. Its values are below. 
#   1) "official": An official build purposed for external release/deployment and built by either
#                  the Build/Release or Operations team.
#   2) "engineering": An engineering build purposed for internal development only and
#                  built by a developer or someone not in neither the Build/Release or Operations team.
#   3) "development": A build purposed for internal development or testing only (NOT for external
#                  deployment) but built by either the Build/Release or Operations team.
# Its default value is "engineering". For other types, change to the appropriate value.

#
# code_label: is the code label in the source code control system (Perforce currently) where 
#             a build is produced. It is used to tag the output .jar and .war files for traceability.
# Notes: 
#    1) For an engineering build, label is not usually created therefore set the code_label variable
#          to null (ex: code_label=null). This is the default value.
#    2) For an official or a development build where a label is created, set the code_label variable
#          to the label name (ex: code_label=Joz_dev_20070926).
#    As a result, a file named ${code_label}.version.properties will be packaged into the product
#          .jar and/or .war files.
